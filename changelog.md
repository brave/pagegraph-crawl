---

For tests, use the callback for the `kill` call from `tree-kill` and increase
the timeout to 10sec, to try and reduce occasional false-negative test results.


1.2.1
---

Rename several arguments (e.g., `--persist-profile`, `--existing-profile`,
etc.) to make it clearer that these arguments should point to the parent
`--user-data-dir` directory, and not a particular profile within that directory.

Removed some additional, unused dependencies, including the no longer needed
type packages for previously removed dependencies.

Move from `standard` to `neostandard` for linting testing code.

Small bugfixes in handling unexpected request responses in the HAR parsing.

Remove `express` and use `http-server` instead (to further reduce dependencies).


1.1.3
---

Add ability to record a HAR of the crawled page
(PR [#180](https://github.com/brave/pagegraph-crawl/pull/180)).

approaches.

Specify and enforce a minimum node version, v20.0.0.

Clean up and reworking of test runner, including removing the hardcoded
config file for the tests.

Added [standardjs](https://standardjs.com/) linting for test code.

Fixed race in tests that cause random-seeming failures.

Minor version bumps in dependencies.

for the same reason.

Remove some no longer needed dependencies.

1.0.2
---

Fix issue with some landing pages not loading.

1.0.1
---

Add this `changelog.md` file, and start tagging releases.
